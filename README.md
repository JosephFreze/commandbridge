# CommandBridge

CommandBridge is an early-stage desktop automation project focused on exploring how typed user commands can be safely translated into real system and browser actions.

The goal of this project is not to create an unrestricted command executor, but rather a controlled automation assistant that routes user intent through a defined set of tools with safeguards, confirmations, and logging.

# WARNING!!!

This project is under construction. This code may be volatile, and any damage to your computer is your responsibility.

## Project Status

This project is in its initial planning and prototyping phase.  
Core architecture, design decisions, and foundational components are being established before full functionality is implemented.

## Initial Goals

- Create a simple GUI for entering commands
- Design a command routing system that maps user input to known actions
- Implement a tool-based architecture where each action is explicitly defined
- Ensure safety through confirmations, permissions, and logging

## Possible Goals for Later

- Arbitrary code execution
- Unrestricted system access
- Fully natural language understanding

## Planned Direction

As the project progresses, CommandBridge may support:
- Browser automation workflows
- Guarded system actions
- Plugin-style tool extensions
- Command history and audit logging

This repository will be updated incrementally as features are designed, implemented, and refined throughout the semester.
